  * Type `open EvernoteImport.scpt` in a Terminal, or double-click `EvernoteImport.scpt` in Finder, should open the script with Apple Script Editor, typically `/Applications/Utilities/Script Editor.app`
  * Optionally, change the notebook title to the notebook where you'd want to store all your Apple Notes.
  * Optionally, change/add tags.
  * Run The Script (Click `Play` button)

Evernote should now contain all your Apple Notes (iCloud Notes) in a separate Notebook.
